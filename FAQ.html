                <h3 style="color:white">How are transparent elections possible within your online voting system?</h3>
                <h4 style="color:white">Transparency is the most critical aspect of hosting a legitimate election; if one cannot audit the results of an election themselves, then how can they be assured that the results are accurate? The key differentiator of our online voting system when compared to other voting systems being used in elections today is that our system provides transparency into the election results, as all voters will have access to the blockchain-based ballot box that contains every ballot that is cast within each election. Being that all users have access to this information at all times, any user could audit the results of an election at any time to ensure the election results being reported are truly accurate.</h4>
